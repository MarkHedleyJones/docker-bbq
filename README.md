# docker-flow

A templated workflow to help develop software designed to run inside Docker containers.

This tool might be useful if you:
* often create *run.sh* scripts to launch containers during development, or
* find yourself creating new Docker projects by duplicating parts of previous ones, or
* find yourself running `docker run -it -v ...` more often than you think you should have to.
